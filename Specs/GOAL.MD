Summary: We want to rewrite the application under Baseline as a modern agentic application.

Baseline application scope: The current Baseline application is a monolithic web application written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS using the .NET MVC framework. It provides a user interface for managing orders as a Kanban board, allowing users to create, update, and track orders through various stages of fulfillment in the context of an electronic repair business. It also provides reporting features to analyze order data.

Goal: Rewrite the Baseline application as a modern agentic application. Rigth side panel always on to chat with the AI assistant taking roughly 30% of the screen, left side used to show a kanban board (like in the baseline application and to show order details like in the baseline application). The AI assistant should help users manage orders, provide insights, and automate repetitive tasks. The application should be built using a modern frontend framework and a backend framework that supports RESTful APIs. The application should also integrate with the existing database (e.g., Azure SQL Server) and minimize database schema changes. A connection string will be provided as well as the existing database schema.
